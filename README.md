[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Due to Maven's design, elements are inherited from the parent POM to the project POM.)

[//]: # (While most of the inheritance is fine, it also inherits unwanted elements like `<license>` and `<developers>` from the)

[//]: # (parent.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (To prevent this, the project POM contains empty overrides for these elements.)

[//]: # (If you manually switch to a different parent and actually want the inheritance, you need to remove those overrides.)



### Project Description
### Purpose of the Project

This is a  system for managing agricultural and animal operations.
From the structure and files, it’s designed as a Farm System with JWT-based security.

### Key Features (based on controllers & entities)

### Authentication & Security

* AuthUserController, JWTConfigFilter, SequrityConfig

* Implements JWT login/authentication to secure APIs.

* Manages user roles (e.g., administrative, manager, scientist, staff).

### User & Staff Management

UserController, StaffController

Create, update, delete, and manage users and staff.

Staff roles (StaffRole.java) define different permissions/responsibilities.

### Field,planand animal Management

FieldController, AnimalController

Manage fields, assign animals and plants to fields.

Handle plants and animal data (planting, harvesting, etc.).

### Equipment & Vehicle Management

EquipmentController, VehicleController

Keep records of equipment and vehicles used in farming.

Likely tracks availability, maintenance, and assignments.

### Logs & Monitoring

LogController, HealthCheckController

Store operation logs (activities, issues, usage).

System health/status checking.

### DTO & Entity Layer

DTOs (AnimalDTO, FieldDTO, VehicleDTO…) for data transfer.

Entities (AnimalEntity, UserEntity, etc.) map to database tables.

### Exception Handling

Custom exceptions (CropNotFoundException, DataPersistException, etc.).

AppWideExceptionHandler (typo in file: AddWideExceptionHandler.java) for global error handling.

### In Summary

This project is meant to:

Provide a secured API for managing an farm business.

Handle users, staff, plants,animals, fields, equipment, and vehicles.

Keep operation logs and perform system checks.
